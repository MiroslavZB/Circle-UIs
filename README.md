# circleuis

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is an example of two circle UIs I've built. 
Since this is taken out of a project and is made to be usable as a template, 
the colors aren't made to look nice. Make sure you keep a look at the output 
of the program since some features have been removed that would usually interrupt 
the flow of the program. \n\n All Required items must be completed by clicking in 
the Center and then stopping first, before you can go to Additional. If you click 
away on the screen, the focus is lost. so thats why everything disappears. The 
style is different on the two circle UIs. On the first one, you have a fancier 
highlight but no immediate feedback on completion, so you have to click on another 
item to see the change in completion state. \n\nOn the second UI, there are 3 sets, 
with 3 different sets of items which each needs completion individually. The first 
Set has two sets in addition to it. The Second and Third Set intentionally have only 
2 items. ,
